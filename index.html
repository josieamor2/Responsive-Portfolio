                Hello, my name is Josie! I am currently taking this course in order to travel the world. I love to see new places and experience
                different cultures. The dream is to be able to find a great position that lets me work remotely and experience
                a different country each month and enjoy being on the move all the time.
            </p>

                Right now I am working at a very slow job that uses internet explorer and a 10 year old fulfillment software system. I have
                to use a PC which I hate, and keep getting my short keys messed up. I can't wait to learn I can so I don't
                have to continue working for this company and get to be free to roam.
            </p>
